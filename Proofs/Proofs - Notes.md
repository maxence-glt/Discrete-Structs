###### Proofs
- A proof is a finite sequence of steps called *logical deductions* which establish the truth of a desired statement.
	- *Finite* meaning we can guarantee the truth of a statement with *infinitely* many cases
###### The structure of a proof
- Start with axioms (or postulates), these are statements we accept without 

###### Ways to prove
1. By Example (or Counterexample)
2. [[Direct]] (Prove $P \implies Q$)
3. By Contraposition (Prove $P \implies Q$ by proving $\neg Q \implies \neg P$)
4. By Contradiction (Prove P by assuming $\neg P$ and reaching a contradiction)
5. By Cases (enumerate an exhaustive set of cases)
###### Extra
- Integers closed under addition
	- $a, b \in Z \implies a + b \in Z$
- a | b means "a divides b"
	- 2 | 4 is True but 7 | 23 is False
